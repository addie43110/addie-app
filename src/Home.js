        Thanks for checking out my Resumesite 2.0. Resumesite 1.0 was originally written entirely by hand in vanilla HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript (weird flex but ok); In 2020, I was lucky to intern with Daitan Labs of Canada and learned React and Express there, so I 
        figured it was time for a website revamp.
